# Python Search Algorithms
<p>ðŸ‘‹ This repo contains simple search algorithms like Hop search, Interpolation search, Exponential search and Fibonacci search! All algorithms are present as individual methods in the SearchAlgorithms class. Created this repo to teach basics to absolute newbies! Basic explaination of each algorithm is attached below. Following algorithms are included:</p>
<p>
1. <strong>Linear Search</strong><br>
2. <strong>Binary Search</strong>(Recursive approach)<br>
3. <strong>Exponential Search</strong><br>
4. <strong>Interpolation Search</strong><br>
5. <strong>Hop Search</strong><br>
